# Data Visualization Portolio
## Introduction 
I am a Psychometrician working at an EdTech company that offers online course and practices to help students on their test prep journey. During my doctoral training in statistics and measurment, I had psychometrics internships with all of the top 3 test publisher companies and had worked part-time for state government on modeling assessment data. Throughout the years, I have produced numerous data visualizations to aid explainations of statistical results, and have presented them to educators, policy makers, fellow psychometricians and test developers. I would like this portfolio to showcase plots that have helped me to interpret and present statistical results. 

The research and modeling I do in my work involves assessment data from a large variety of high-stakes assessments. Therefore, most of my work are proprietary. As much as I want to show all of the amazing visualizations I have created, I have to leave some of them out due to confidentiality. For the same reason, codes used to generate these plots are not available. 

## Inventory 
### 1. Adaptive Item Selection in an Single-Item Adaptive Test 
Description: A single-item adaptive test selects an item to minimize the measurement error given the examinee's real-time performance evaluation in accordance to his/her responses to all previous test items. The GMAT and the NCLEX are all examples of the single-item adaptive test. The expectiation in this particular setup is that the closer the item difficulty parameter is with the real-time performance evaluation, the higest efficiency is in minimizing the measurement error. So the item difficulty drifting away from the real-time performance evaluation is a indication of insufficient items in the item pool.
